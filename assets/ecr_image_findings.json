A crafted ELF input can cause a segmentation fault leading to denial of service (program crash) because ebl_core_note does not reject malformed core file notes. CVE-2019-7664: 99999: CVE-2019-7664 elfutils: out of bound write in elf_cvt_note in libelf/note_xlate.h In elfutils 0.175, a negative-sized memcpy is attempted in elf_cvt_note in libelf/note_xlate.h because of an incorrect overflow check. Crafted elf input causes a segmentation fault, leading to denial of service (program crash). CVE-2019-7150: 99999: CVE-2019-7150 elfutils: segmentation fault in elf64_xlatetom in libelf/elf32_xlatetom.c An issue was discovered in elfutils 0.175. A segmentation fault can occur in the function elf64_xlatetom in libelf/elf32_xlatetom.c, due to dwfl_segment_report_module not checking whether the dyn data read from a core file is truncated. A crafted input can cause a program crash, leading to denial-of-service, as demonstrated by eu-stack. CVE-2019-7149: 99999: CVE-2019-7149 elfutils: heap-based buffer over-read in read_srclines in dwarf_getsrclines.c in libdw A heap-based buffer over-read was discovered in the function read_srclines in dwarf_getsrclines.c in libdw in elfutils 0.175. A crafted input can cause segmentation faults, leading to denial-of-service, as demonstrated by eu-nm. CVE-2018-18521: 99999: CVE-2018-18521 elfutils: Divide-by-zero in arlib_add_symbols function in arlib.c Divide-by-zero vulnerabilities in the function arlib_add_symbols() in arlib.c in elfutils 0.174 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) with a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated by eu-ranlib, because a zero sh_entsize is mishandled. CVE-2018-18520: An Invalid Memory Address Dereference exists in the function elf_end in libelf in elfutils through v0.174. Although eu-size is intended to support ar files inside ar files, handle_ar in size.c closes the outer ar file before handling all inner entries. The vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) with a crafted ELF file. 99999: CVE-2018-18520 elfutils: eu-size cannot handle recursive ar files CVE-2018-18310: 99999: CVE-2018-18310 elfutils: invalid memory address dereference was discovered in dwfl_segment_report_module.c in libdwfl An invalid memory address dereference was discovered in dwfl_segment_report_module.c in libdwfl in elfutils through v0.174. The vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) with a crafted ELF file, as demonstrated by consider_notes. CVE-2018-16403: libdw in elfutils 0.173 checks the end of the attributes list incorrectly in dwarf_getabbrev in dwarf_getabbrev.c and dwarf_hasattr in dwarf_hasattr.c, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read and an application crash. 99999: CVE-2018-16403 elfutils: Heap-based buffer over-read in libdw/dwarf_getabbrev.c and libwd/dwarf_hasattr.c causes crash CVE-2018-16402: libelf/elf_end.c in elfutils 0.173 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (double free and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact because it tries to decompress twice. 99999: CVE-2018-16402 elfutils: Double-free due to double decompression of sections in crafted ELF causes crash CVE-2018-16062: 99999: CVE-2018-16062 elfutils: Heap-based buffer over-read in libdw/dwarf_getaranges.c:dwarf_getaranges() via crafted file An out-of-bounds read was discovered in elfutils in the way it reads DWARF address ranges information. Function dwarf_getaranges() in dwarf_getaranges.c does not properly check whether it reads beyond the limits of the ELF section. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.",
